<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>
A geothermal power plant utilizes heat from the Earth’s interior to generate electricity. In regions with naturally occurring hot water wells, geothermal fluid (a mixture of steam and hot water) is extracted through production wells. The thermal energy is transferred to a working fluid in a heat exchanger, which then drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator. The cooled geothermal fluid is reinjected back underground through injection wells to maintain reservoir pressure and sustainability. Depending on temperature, the plant can use dry steam, flash steam, or binary cycle technology. This system provides a continuous and renewable source of energy, independent of weather conditions. It is suitable for areas with geothermal resources and supports clean electricity generation with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. It helps reduce fossil fuel dependency while offering base-load power for local communities.

      The OTEC system can simultaneously generate electricity and freshwater through desalination processes. 
      It is suitable for tropical coastal regions where temperature differences exceed 20°C. 
      OTEC is a sustainable solution that provides power and potable water to island or coastal communities with minimal environmental impact.
