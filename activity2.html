<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>
The biogas system uses cattle dung and organic farm waste as biomass feedstock. Collected dung is mixed with water to form slurry and fed into an anaerobic digester where microbial activity breaks down organic matter in the absence of oxygen. This process produces biogas—primarily methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). Biogas is stored in a gas holder and can be used in a gas engine or combined heat and power (CHP) unit to produce electricity and heat for farm operations (lighting, water heating, and a small generator for local loads). The digestate (leftover slurry) is nutrient-rich and can be used as organic fertilizer, closing the waste-to-resource loop. For 100 cattle, daily dung yields are sufficient for a small-scale digester sized appropriately (tank volume based on retention time and feedstock). Benefits include waste management, reduced odor and pathogens, renewable energy generation, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

      The methane-rich biogas is then cleaned and used to power generators or for cooking and heating purposes. 
      The leftover slurry acts as a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer. 
      This system reduces greenhouse gas emissions, manages waste efficiently, and provides sustainable energy for the dairy farm.
